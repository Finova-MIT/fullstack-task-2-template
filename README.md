# Task 2: Introduction to Vite, JS/TS

## **Objective**  
The goal of this task is to familiarize you with Vite, JavaScript and TypeScript by implementing the client-side functionality for your previously created interface for a stock price guessing game.

---

## Prerequisites
Before beginning the task, ensure you have the following installed:  
- **Node.js** ([Download Page](https://nodejs.org/en))  
- **Vite (Vanilla + TypeScript)** ([Setup Guide](https://vite.dev/guide/))  
- **Git** ([Download Page](https://git-scm.com/downloads))

## Git Workflow Warning
ðŸš¨ **Many participants did not use the Git CLI for the first task. From now on, using the Git CLI is mandatory. GUI-based Git clients and Drag and Drop uploads should be avoided.**  

Refer to [Task 1](https://github.com/Finova-MIT/fullstack-task-1-template/blob/main/README.md#git-basics) for the essential Git commands you are expected to use during this task.

## Task: Functional Implementation for Stock Guessing Game UI
**Goal:** Extend your previous UI implementation to fetch the current stock price and implement the guessing logic.

### **Requirements:**  
1. **Fetch stock price from API:** Use the following API to get the current stock price:  
   **API:** `https://finova-mancomm.vercel.app/api/stock`  
2. **Validate input:**  
   - Guess must be a **number**.  
   - Guess must **not exceed 2 decimal places**.  
   - Guess must be **non-negative**.  
   - Guess must **not be greater than 1000**.  
3. **Implement guessing logic:** Compare the guessed price with the API value and display the success or failure message accordingly.

## Submission Guidelines
1.  Clone your  **auto-generated repository**  (repository created when you accepted this assignment).
2.  Work on your implementation in the  **auto-generated repository**.
3.  Ensure your code is  **properly structured and commented**.
4. Include a `README.md` or a `Submission.md` file with:
   - **A screen-recorded video or GIF** of the working implementation
   - **Screenshots of Git commands** used throughout development.  
   - **Screenshot of project hierarchy** to show modularization.  

---

## **6. Evaluation Criteria**  
Your submission will be graded based on:  
- Use of **TypeScript over JavaScript**.  
- **Code organization and modularization**.  
- Proper **validation and input handling**.  
- Adherence to the **Git CLI workflow**.  
- Clean and readable code.  

### **Bonus Points:**  
- Using a **custom popup element** instead of JavaScript `alert` for messages.  
- Writing clean, well-organized, and modularized TypeScript code.
